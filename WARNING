WARNING: This is a development branch ONLY.  This is not guaranteed to
compile, work, or even make sense -- though we do hope that it will
eventually be merged back with the main fbmuck branch.

There are several issues that we are attempting, within this branch:
1) Code simplification
2) Code modularization
3) Migrate to a real database system (Sleepycat db4)
4) Fix compression so it's GPL-compatible
5) Simplify architecture and APIs for ease of auditing

There may be other goals that come up through the course of our modification;
these are the goals we are currently working toward.

Do NOT even attempt to run this code in a production or testing environment.
As soon as it's ready, it will be re-integrated with the original codebase.

You have been warned.
