TinyMUCK 2.2fb6.x should now be easier to compile on various systems.
The steps for compiling your muck are now to:

(1) edit the file config.h in the "include" directory, this lets
    you set some preferences. The defaults for most of it should be
    acceptable.

(2) cd into the "src" directory if you're not already there.

(3) Type "./configure", this is a /bin/sh script generated by
    GNU's "autoconf-1.7" package, and will try and figure out what
    include files, library functions, and such your system has.
    ( If you wish to see some of what it finds out, you can
    also run it "./configure -v" and/or read the file "autoconf.h"
    in the include directory. )

(4) Type "make".

In the best of all worlds this should produce a fully compiled netmuck
on any unix in existance. Being that the world is not perfect, however,
here are some tips:

*       If it chooses gcc, and gcc is broken on your system (such as
        Ultrix on a MIPS), you can run "CC=cc ; configure" to force it
        to use your local compiler. (or: "setenv CC cc ; configure" for
        you csh/tcsh users)

*       In some really bad cases you may have problems in wiz.c with
        either the do_usage function, or do_memory. Look for the defines
        in config.h NO_USAGE_COMMAND and NO_MEMORY_COMMAND.

*       Also in obscure cases you may have a problem with strftime.c,
        look for the USE_STRFTIME in config.h for some help there.

If you have to do any of these, or have other problems compiling the
server, please contact foxen@belfry.com describing the problem, what
system you are using (uname -a output perferably), and a log of the
compile errors. I will likely also ask for your "autoconf.h" results.

Even if you can fix it yourself, it is helpful to find out what it took
to get it working on your system so that I can make sure later releases
will support your system, and any other system with the same problems.
