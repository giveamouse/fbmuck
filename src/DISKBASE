Diskbase by propdir.
Use gdbm or equivalent.
Limit propdir/leaf prop names to 24 chars.
When too many props are in a propdir, split them up into 32 property chunks.
If a propdir chunk grows to 48 props, split the chunk into two chunks.
If two consecutive propdir chunks shrink below 32 props total, join them.
