LearFox pages, "5.56, conboot corrupts the DB basically." to you.

LearFox pages, "symptoms are: when a player logs on, no programs
runned via _connect props can use the match primitive to find them." to
you.

LearFox pages, "when a player has their name changed via force
(the MUF primitive) *and* they immediately disconnect, for some reason
it currupts something in their data record so that when they log on, the
symptoms occure.  There is a way to fix it.   Yes non _connect runned
programs can match them." to you.

LearFox pages, "have the player log on and type QUIT, that seems
to fix the problem... however this is a problem for guest programs that
run via connect prop since they use conboot instead of having the player
type QUIT to disconnect." to you.

LearFox pages, "LearFox used her own con-guest.muf.  I think
reciting the procedures leading up to the problem would help.  Basically
when a player logs on Guest, the con-guest program is triggered, then
checks if the player name matches the Guest name, since it does it uses
"name me=Guest1 guest" force.   during that moment, IF the player
manually disconnects using QUIT, the problem is seeded." to you.

LearFox pages, "once that happens, the next player loggin on as
Guest, con-guest is triggered, it tries to find the next available guest
player, Guest1, but "*Guest1" match returns #-1 and con-guest thinks
there are no more guest characters available and uses conboot to
disconnect Guest." to you.

LearFox pages, "anyways, the problem is fixed when the guest
program is removed from the _connect propdir and the Guest allowed to
connect normally, then manuall QUIT, then restore the _connect call to
con-guest and things start working normally again." to you.
