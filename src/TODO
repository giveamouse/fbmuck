ARRAY_FILTER_PROP ([d] s1 s2 -- [d']) Takes a homogenous list array of dbrefs,
  and returns a list array with only those dbrefs who have a property specified
  by s1, set to a value that smatch matches s2.
ARRAY_EXTRACT ([?] [@] -- [?]) Takes an array, and returns every element whose
  name is in the index array. (The @ means an index item.  String or int.)
ARRAY_JOIN ([s] s -- s) Takes a list array of strings and a delimiter string,
  and returns a single string that is the concatenation of all the strings in
  the list array, with the delimiter string in between.  For example:
    { "one" "two" "three" }list "... " array_join
  will result in a single string: "one... two... three"

REFLIST_ADD ( ref:ToAdd ref:Object str:PropName -- ) Adds a dbref to a
  reflist if it is not already in the list.
REFLIST_DELETE ( ref:ToDel ref:Object str:PropName -- ) Removed a dbref from
  a reflist if it is in it.
REFLIST_FIND ( ref:ToFind ref:Object str:PropName -- int:Position ) Finds a
  given dbref in a reflist, and returns its position.  Returns 0 if not found.
  First dbref in reflist is 1.

CORD_OPEN  (          intDescr strType -- strCordID)
CORD_SEND  (strCordID strName dictData -- )
CORD_CLOSE (                 strCordID -- )
