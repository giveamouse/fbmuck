ARRAY_NOTIFY ([d] [s] -- ) Takes a homogenous list array of dbrefs, and a
    homogenous list array of strings, and displays the strings to the given
    dbrefs.
ARRAY_FILTER_PROP ([d] s1 s2 -- [d']) Takes a homogenous list array of dbrefs,
    and returns a list array with only those dbrefs who have a property
    specified by s1, set to a value that smatch matches s2.
ARRAY_EXTRACT ([?] [@] -- [?]} Takes an array, and returns every element whose
    name is in the index array. (The @ means an index item.  String or int.)
