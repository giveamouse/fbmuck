ARRAY_FILTER_PROP ([d] s1 s2 -- [d']) Takes a homogenous list array of dbrefs,
  and returns a list array with only those dbrefs who have a property specified
  by s1, set to a value that smatch matches s2.
ARRAY_EXTRACT ([?] [@] -- [?]) Takes an array, and returns every element whose
  name is in the index array. (The @ means an index item.  String or int.)
ARRAY_JOIN ([s] s -- s) Takes a list array of strings and a delimiter string,
  and returns a single string that is the concatenation of all the strings in
  the list array, with the delimiter string in between.  For example:
    { "one" "two" "three" }list "... " array_join
  will result in a single string: "one... two... three"
