These items are mandatory for FB6 release.
  Integrate multiple listener ports mods.
  Fix compression bugs, or implement new compression schema.
  Separate MPI perms away from Builder bit a la ProtoMUCK.
  Implement Viewable flag for MUF program @listing.
  Integrate time() speedups.

  Modify array code to allow floats and dbrefs as indexes.
  ARRAY_FILTER_PROP ([d] s1 s2 -- [d']) Takes a homogenous list array of
    dbrefs, and returns a list array with only those dbrefs who have a
    property specified by s1, set to a value that smatch matches s2.
  ARRAY_FILTER_LOCK ([d] l -- [d']) As per ARRAY_FILTER_PROP, except only
    those dbrefs that would pass the given lock are returned.

  REFLIST_ADD ( ref:ToAdd ref:Object str:PropName -- ) Adds a dbref to a
    reflist if it is not already in the list.
  REFLIST_DELETE ( ref:ToDel ref:Object str:PropName -- ) Removed a dbref
    from a reflist if it is in it.
  REFLIST_FIND ( ref:ToFind ref:Object str:PropName -- int:Position ) Finds
    a given dbref in a reflist, and returns its position.  Returns 0 if not
    found.  The first dbref in the reflist is 1.

  CORD_OPEN  (          intDescr strType -- strCordID)
  CORD_SEND  (strCordID strName dictData -- )
  CORD_CLOSE (                 strCordID -- )

  WATCHPROP (d s -- ) Specifies that this process wants to recieve an event
    when the given property on the given object is set, deleted, or changed.
	The event recieved will have an ID of "PROPCHANGE.#dbref.propname" where
	the dbref and the property name will be replaced by those of the property
	you specified.
  FINDNEXT (d s1 s2 -- d) Finds the next object that matches the name pattern
    s2, and the flag pattern s1.  The flag pattern is the same as that used in
    @find or @owned.  A dbref of #-1 is returned when no more items match.
    The search is debug with a dbref of #-1.  (Note - should this be broken down
    into a FIND command and then just have a FINDNEXT ( d -- d ) portion?)


These items may be considered to be optional for release:
  ISO-Latin high-bit character support.
  SWITCH/CASE compiler support within MUF.
  Secure communications layer.
  Hashed passwords in database.  If this is implemented, there _must_ exist a
    command line option to reset #1's password.
  MUF ability to call in-server commands acting as player (ie: WHO, or @dig).


These items may be considered to be a wishlist:
  In-server gagging based on lock-style structures.  This would ensure that
    any text that was generated by something or someone which 'passed' the
    given lock string, would never be sent to the user.
  Player Point-of-View forwarding.  This would allow a program or a player to
    see _exactly_ what a given player is seeing, if the source player allows
    it via the use of a lock and a _listen - styled proplist _and_ a matching
    'receive' lock on the target (in the case of players/objects/rooms).
  TCP/IP socket communications layer.
  Matrix math.
  3-d manipulation primitives.
