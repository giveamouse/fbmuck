Make sure that you do a backup of your database and MUF before upgrading
to any new version of the server.  The server seems stable, when I
release it, but that doesn't mean that it won't eat up all of your
database, spit out garbage, and nuke everything.  It just means that I
haven't SEEN it do that in my testing.  Occasionally I miss big errors,
and your only protection, until I can get a fixed version out, is to have
backups.  Make backups regularly, and keep one a few weeks old, in case
an insidious error creeps in and corrupts your db over time.

I can't say it enough... BACK UP YOUR DB.
