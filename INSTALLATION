Installation in a non-shared environment is fairly simple:

	Edit include/config.h to fit your preferences and your system.
	Edit include/params.h also.

	Then do the following:
		./configure --prefix=$HOME/fbmuck
		make
	(The argument to --prefix is the name of the directory you want
	all the fbmuck program and support files to be installed to.  If
	you do not include it, it will default to /usr/local; if you do not
	specify a directory that you have write access to, the next step
	will fail.)

	Then:
		make install    

	Go to the directory you named in the --prefix, then edit
	game/restart to refer to the apropriate paths and database files.
	After doing this, to start the muck, do the following:
		cd game
		./restart

Installation in a shared environment is a little trickier:

	Edit include/config.h to fit your preferences and system.  Remember
	that these will affect ALL servers that use these binaries.
	Edit include/params.h as well.

	Do the following:
		./configure
	(If you want your MUCKs to have the capability to use SSL, ensure
	you have the OpenSSL headers and libraries installed on your system
	and add '--enable-ssl' to that command line.)

	Then, type:
		make
	This should give you no errors, unless you chose to enable SSL, and
	don't have the OpenSSL libraries and headers installed.  (If you do
	come across an error, feel free to contact us on SourceForge at
	http://sf.net/projects/fbmuck !)  If it comes out okay, type:
		make install
	to install the binaries to /usr/local/bin and the shared help files
	to /usr/local/share/fbmuck.

	If you wish to use the provided System-V or RedHat startup scripts,
	you can type:
		make install-inits
	This will copy the appropriate script to the appropriate place on
	your system, and use chkconfig(8) to install the appropriate links
	into your /etc/rc.d directories.  Please see the file
	scripts/fbmuck-sysvinit for more information on configuration.
	(The RedHat startup script works the same way.)
