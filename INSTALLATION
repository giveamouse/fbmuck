Installation is fairly simple:

edit include/config.h to fit your preferences and your system.
edit include/params.h also.
edit game/restart to refer to the apropriate paths and database files.

./configure          # This configures the source for your system.
make                 # This compiles the binaries.
make install         # This puts the binaries in /usr/local/fbmuck/bin
cd ../game
./restart            # This starts the server.
