Installation is fairly simple:

	Edit include/config.h to fit your preferences and your system.
	Edit include/params.h also.

		./configure     # This configures the source for your system.
		make            # This compiles the binaries.

	If you have root access on your system, do the following as root:
		make install    # This puts the binaries in /usr/local/fbmuck/bin

	If you do NOT have root access on your system, do this instead:
		cp src/netmuck src/resolver game

	Edit game/restart to refer to the apropriate paths and database files.
	To start the muck, do the following:
		cd game
		./restart
