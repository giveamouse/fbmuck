/* $Header$ */

Function Name:	show_program_usage
Arguments:	char * (name of program)
Returns:	never
Called from:	main (interface.c)
Calls:		fprintf, exit
Does:		Prints program command usage to standard error, and exits
		with error status (1).
#ifdefs:	none
Notes:
1) This is about as simple as a function can get.  No branches.

Function Name:	main
Arguments:	int (argument count)
		char ** (argument values)
		char ** (environment values)
Returns:	int (0 on success)
Called from:	<init>
Calls:		strcmp, show_program_usage, chdir, atoi, fprintf,
		fclose, fopen, log_status, freopen, setbuf, setsid,
		spgrp, setpgid, getpid, open, ioctl, close, spawn_resolver,
		do_setuid, mcp_initialize, gui_initialize, init_game,
		set_signals, sanity, sanfix, shovechars, close_sockets,
		do_dequeue, rwhocli_shutdown, san_main, dump_database,
		tune_save_parmsfile, kill_resolver, db_free,
		free_old_macros, purge_all_free_frames, purge_mfns,
		unlink, CrT_summarize_to_file, execl, exit, return
Does:		Starts up the MUCK, verifies that it's in a sane
		environment (and checks the database to see if it's in
		a sane state), does a few other things depending on what
		the commandline asked for, starts the MUCK listening, and
		then shuts everything down when the MUCK stops listening.
#ifdefs:	DETACH, DISKBASE, DETACH, SYS_POSIX, SYSV, TIOCNOTTY,
		SPAWN_HOST_RESOLVER, MUD_ID, MALLOC_PROFILING, DELTADUMPS
Defines used:	TINYPORT, VERSION, TIOCNOTTY, MUD_ID, AMBIGUOUS,
		DELTAFILE_NAME
Notes:
1)	Generic startup-in-our-environment multiple-branching codepathing.


Function Name:	queue_ansi
Arguments:	struct descriptor_data * (descriptor info)
		const char * (string to be sent)
called from:	
calls:		FLAGS, strip_bad_ansi, strip_ansi, mcp_frame_output_inband,
		strlen
Does:		If player is set CHOWN_OK (COLOR_OK is the term for this
		usage), and the descriptor that's causing it to be called
		is connected, the string passed is stripped of only bad
		ansi codes (by strip_bad_ansi), and then is queued.  If
		the descriptor is not connected, or the player is NOT set
		CHOWN_OK (COLOR_OK), all ansi codes are stripped from the
		string (by strip_ansi), before the string is queued for
		output to the descriptor passed.  (Essentially, if the
		player doesn't want to see color, he can set himself !C
		and this is the place that preference will be implemented.)
#ifdefs:	none
Defines used:	BUFFER_LEN, CHOWN_OK, FLAGS
Notes:
1) Implementation for COLOR_OK or !COLOR_OK on a player.

Function Name:	notify_nolisten
Arguments:	dbref (object to notify)
		const char * (string to notify)
		int (isprivate<unknown functionality>)
Called From:	<everywhere>
Calls:		uncompress, unmangle, queue_ansi, Typeof, FLAGS, OWNER,
		Wizard, getloc, GETPECHO, do_parse_mesg, NAME, sprintf,
		strlen
Does:
#ifdefs:	COMPRESS, ANONYMITY
Defines Used:
Notes:
1) This is (appears to be) the primary notifier for things that should not
be echoed to anything other than the descriptor (or the player's descriptor,
in the case of zombies and so on).

Function Name:	notify_from_echo
Arguments:	dbref (from)
		dbref (player)
		const char * (string to tell)
		int (isprivate<unknown functionality>)
Called From:
Calls:
Does:
#ifdefs:
Notes:

Caveats: 
1)	If BOOLEXP_DEBUGGING is #define'd, neither show_program_usage()
	or main() get compiled.
