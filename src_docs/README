In the fbmuck module, there's now a directory called src_docs/. When you
modify the functionality of a piece of code, write it up and put it in
here (if we need to reference how it -used- to work, we can always go
back to a previous version in the CVS tree). Proposed form is: 

filename.[ch].txt: Description of each source file (renamed with .txt at
the end to help prevent accidental mistakes). 

MPI.txt, MUF.txt, property.txt, db.txt, etc: Anything having to do with
how the various subsystems work (eventually will have a list of all
functions related to the subsystem, as well as all functions each one of
these functions calls, and overviews of how each system works). 

global.txt: Global variables, as well as where each is read and touched,
and (hopefully) why. 

PREPROC.txt: preprocessor defines, where they're used, what they're used
for, and (if used in a #ifdef) what branches of code they enable/disable. 

The contents of this posting will be placed in the file README in the
src-docs/ directory, where it can be updated as needed.
